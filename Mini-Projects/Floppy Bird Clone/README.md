# Flappy Bird Clone in Python
This Python program emulates the popular Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. The code encompasses functions for initializing the game, rendering graphical elements, and handling player input. Throughout the game loop, the player guides a bird through a series of pipes while avoiding collisions. The game runs continuously until it determines that the game is over, at which point the player's score is displayed. The code also incorporates image loading, game parameter configuration, and a simple start screen that starts the game when the player presses the spacebar key.

## Planning and Implementing the Code
This project was based off of a Geeksforgeeks article on how to build the [flappy bird game](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-flappy-bird-game-in-pygame/). I adjusted the implementation to split the files into the following files:
- config.py
- game.py
- image_loader.py
- main.py
- requirements.txt

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Pygame: Install the Pygame library by running `pip install pygame`.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-clone.git
   cd flappy-bird-clone
3. **Run the Game:**
   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```
