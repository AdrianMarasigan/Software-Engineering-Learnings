# Flappy Bird Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. In this game, you control a bird and try to navigate it through a series of pipes without crashing into them. Your score increases as you successfully pass through the pipes. The game includes the following files:

- `app.py`: The main Python script for the game.
- `images/`: A folder containing the images used in the game.
- `requirements.txt`: A file specifying the required library (Pygame) and its version.

## How to Play

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required library by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Game: Run the game by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Game Controls:
 - Use the Spacebar or Up Arrow Key to make the bird flap its wings and gain altitude.
 - The objective is to pass the bird through the gaps between the pipes.

4. Scoring: Your score increases every time you pass through a set of pipes. Try to get the highest score possible!

5. Game Over: The game ends when the bird crashes into the ground or one of the pipes.

6. Restart the Game: To restart the game, press Spacebar or Up Arrow Key again.
