# Software Engineering Journey
This repository is a record of my Software Engineering journey. It contains my highlighted projects, details about me, and my full curriculum with self-documented notes and any code associated I've implemented to the learnings.

## About Me
I have 5 years years of experience in technical project management, product management, and application support. While the work was fulfilling, these roles gradually built my passion for building software before I decided to dedicate my efforts full-time to becoming a software eningeer.

Prior to my software engineering journey, I worked in healthcare and pharmaceuticals. My shift to software development started when I spearheaded the requirements for an inventory management system, where I collaborated with 13 organizations on understanding how they captured data and worked with the development team to build a data model and document requirements.
